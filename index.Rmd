## Traditional Model of a Research Document

A document and its elements as static entities: 

* document
* figures
* data tables 
* appendices

## New Model: Dynamic Research Document 

* A document where everything is contained that you need to re-run the experiment or models that produced the data. Including the code. 

* A document that is not siloed in a particular tool (Word doc) but can be easily converted to other types.

* A document that can contain interactive visualizations and embedded apps.

* A document that could be its own web app, github page, or slide presentation.

## Reproducibility 

* other people can re-run your code
* transparency for other researchers
* files are dynamic
* easy to share

## Wouldn't it be Cool if...

You could use the same open-source tool for your data cleaning, analysis and publishing?

## What is R? 

R is a programming language for statistical computing and graphics. 

* New Zealand
* created by statisticians named **Ross** and **Robert** 
* robust user community 
* relative obscurity in early 2000s --> top languages for data science today

## What is R Markdown?
**R Markdown** is a version of Markdown, a **text markup tool**, adapted for use in R. 

R Markdown documents are fully reproducible and support dozens of static and dynamic output formats.

![](images/example.png)

## R Markdown Lets Us Have Nice Things

## Versatility 

In an R Markdown file, you can include: 

* HTML  
* LaTeX
* mathjax  
* code chunks in other languages  

```

## R packages for document creation

* **pandoc** - converts documents from one markup format to another
* **rmarkdown** - reads R Markdown. Already included with RStudio.
* **knitr** - generates dynamic reports. Already included with RStudio.
* **LaTeX (for PDFs)** - for Typesetting, useful for math notation and journal article formatting
* **bookdown** - if you want to write books

[More information](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/40563479/relationship-between-r-markdown-knitr-pandoc-and-bookdown) about how these packages work together

## How it works
An R Markdown file (.Rmd) is the file that you will use to create your document.

A typical file has three components:

- header
- code chunks
- text

## Header

```
---
title: "R Markdown for Publishing Documents"
author: "Alison Blaine"
date: "October 2017"
output: html_document
---
```

Written in YAML, a format common for configuration files

**Output options**:

html_document, pdf_document, word_document, md_document, ioslides_presentation, slidy_presentation, beamer_presentation, revealjs_presentation (revealjs package must be installed)


## Header Options: CSS
* You can add a [CSS (Cascading Style Sheet)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) file to your project if you want to change the styling of your document.
* The CSS file must be included in your project directory and named in the header.

```
 ---
 title: "R Markdown for Publishing Documents"
 output: 
   slidy_presentation:
      css: styles.css
---
```

## Header Options: Table of Contents
```
---
title: "R Markdown for Publishing Documents"
output:
  html_document:
    toc: true
    toc_float: true
    number_sections: true
---
```

## Header for this Presentation
```
---
title: "R Markdown for Publishing Documents"
author: "Alison Blaine"
date: "NCSU Libraries"
output: 
  revealjs::revealjs_presentation:
    theme: blood
    highlight: zenburn
    transition: slide
---
```
## Code chunks
Make a code chunk with 3 backticks then {r}.
End chunk with 3 backticks:

![](images/codechunk.png)

## Example

```{r fig.width=4, fig.height=3, echo=TRUE}
attach(mtcars)
plot(wt, mpg, main="Scatterplot Example",
  	xlab="Car Weight ", ylab="Miles Per Gallon ", pch=19)  
```


## Chunk options
Using chunk options, you can set rules for your code chunks. 

* to specify the dimensions of a figure
* to make it so a code chunk does not appear in the final document
* to show or hide the code in the code chunk
* to display or not display error messages generated by the code

`{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}`

## Example 1 {.smaller}

`{r echo=TRUE}`

```{r echo=TRUE}
plot(wt, mpg, main="Scatterplot Example",
  	xlab="Car Weight ", ylab="Miles Per Gallon ", pch=19)  
```

## Example 2 {.smaller}

`{r echo=FALSE}`

```{r echo=FALSE}
plot(wt, mpg, main="Scatterplot Example",
  	xlab="Car Weight ", ylab="Miles Per Gallon ", pch=19)  
```

## Global Chunk Options
These provide rules for all of the chunks in the document.

Example:
`knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)`

![](images/example.png)

## Text
Formatting text requires R Markdown notation. See R Markdown Reference Guide for more examples.

![](images/markdown.png)

normal text  
*italics*  
**bold**

## Rendering Your R Markdown File

Save your .Rmd file, and click the *"Knit"* button that appears above the file.

You can set certain output options by clicking on the gear icon next to the Knit button.

![](images/render.png)


## Templates
There are existing R Markdown templates for html files, slide shows, and scholarly journal article formats. 

* github document
* Package Vignette (HTML)
* [tufte](http://rstudio.github.io/tufte/) is a template for handouts in the style of Edward Tufte.
* [rticles](https://github.com/rstudio/rticles) is a LaTeX academic journal R package.

To use a template, you can install a template package or download it from the source:

install.packages("rticles", type = "source")


## Opening a Template from Installed Package in RStudio
After installing the rticles package:

1. File > New File > R Markdown...
2. Select "From Template"

The window should populate with templates from the rticles package

Note: a *full installation of LaTeX is required* for this to work.

## Hands-On Part Begins 

![](images/hand.png)

## Open R Studio

In RStudio, go to `Help > Cheatsheets > R Markdown Reference Guide`

## Exercise 1: Create an R Markdown file

1. Open RStudio on your computer
2. File > New File > R Markdown
3. Select HTML
4. Title it "HelloWorld"
5. Click the save button. Save as "HelloWorld"
6. Click "Knit Html" to see it render as an HTML file

## Change Your Global Chunk Option 

Try setting your global chunk option to the following. Each time, knit the code to see changes.

`knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)`

`knitr::opts_chunk$set(eval = FALSE)`

## Knit as a Microsoft Word Doc

Change `output: html_document` to `output: word_document`

```
---
title: "Hello World"
author: "Alison Blaine"
date: "10/11/2017"
output: word_document
---
```

## Exercise 2: Open Nile.Rmd file

![](images/addtext.png)

## Overview of Nile.Rmd

This document is about the annual flow (in $m^3$) of the Nile River at Aswan from 1871â€“1970.

Inside your code chunk should be two commands:

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
library(MASS)
summary(Nile)
```

`library(MASS)`  - loads the MASS library of sample datasets  
`summary(Nile)` - shows the statistical summary of the data set

## Add a plot
Skip a line and then **create a new R code chunk** under the previous one. Add a plot inside the chunk with the following command:

```
plot(Nile)
```

![](images/nileplot.png)

## Title the Plot 

```## Flow Over Time```

```{r}
plot(Nile)
```


## Resize the plot by adding a chunk option

Knit when you're finished! 

![](images/figplot.png)
```{r fig.width=5, fig.height=5, echo=FALSE}
plot(Nile)
```

## Fix the y-axis label
Add ylab="Flow rate" inside of your plot function to change the y axis label:
```{r echo=TRUE}
plot(Nile, ylab="Flow rate")
```

## Create a new section 

``` 
## Distribution
```
## Add a Histogram 
```{r echo=TRUE}
hist(Nile)
```

## Fix the Histogram title and x-axis label
```{r echo=TRUE}
hist(Nile, main="Histogram of Nile Flow", xlab="Flow rate")
```

## Add a Floating Table of Contents

```
---
title: "Measuring Nile Flow"
author: "Your Name Here"
date: "March 7, 2018"
output: 
    html_document: 
      toc: true
      toc_float: true
---
```

## Convert Your Document into a Slide Presentation
Pandoc will allow you to convert your html file into a slide presentation.

```
---
title: "Measuring Nile Flow"
author: "Your Name Here"
date: "October 24, 2017"
output: ioslides_presentation
---
```

## Including Shiny in R Markdown
* Shiny is an R framework for creating interactive web applications.
* Shiny widgets and apps can be embedded into an R markdown file, or exist as stand-alone applications.
* Lots of tutorials exist for creating Shiny applications or Shiny widgets embedded in R Markdown documents.

Here are some good ones:

* [Shiny R Studio tutorial](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/interactive-docs.html)
* [How to Build a Shiny App](http://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/)

## Exercise 3: Open Shiny_Nile.Rmd
File > New File > R Markdown > Shiny > Shiny Document

`output: html_document`  
`runtime: shiny`

Shiny documents have "Run Document" buttons. Click this to render the document.

When you save the file, you'll notice that the "Run Document" button appears

## Shiny Code Chunk
After the line plot code, the highlighted code chunk to create an interactive histogram. 

```{r fig.height=4, fig.width=3, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}

# create dropdown selector for histogram
inputPanel(
  selectInput("n_breaks", label= "Bins", c(10, 20, 30, 40), selected = 10)  #creates a dropdown selector
)

# create histogram
renderPlot({
hist(Nile, xlab= "Measurement", probability = TRUE, breaks = as.numeric(input$n_breaks), col="deepskyblue3", 
     main="Histogram of Nile Flow") 
})
```

Run the document. The histogram will update when a new value is selected from the dropdown menu.

## Creating a Simple Website

To create a static website with R Markdown, you need the following files: 

- _site.yml
- an .Rmd file for every page

![](images/website.png)

## Rendering Your Website

Inside directory that contains _site.yml and index.Rmd, type the following line and hit enter: 

`rmarkdown::render_site()`
